# reddit_challenges
Completion of the reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer challenges

### Format of this repository
Each challenge will appear in its own separate branch for a time until I feel it is completed and then will be merged to `master`. 
Old challenge branches will be periodically pruned.

### Contributing
A persistent optimization branch will be available if anyone wants to participate and feels they can speed up some of these algorithms
without sacrificing readability.

Readability will triumph over minor speed enhancements.

If you do contribute don't forget to include your name in `CONTRIBUTORS`
